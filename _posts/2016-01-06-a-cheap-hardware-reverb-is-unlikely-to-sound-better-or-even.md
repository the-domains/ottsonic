A cheap hardware reverb is unlikely to sound better \[or even as good\] as a good plugin reverb. All digital reverbs, whether plugins or outboard, use the same types of algorithm to generate their effect, whilst the hardware version will also need to include a case, power supply, display, physical memory, input and output converters, etc, in the price. A £300 hardware reverb won't sound any better than a £50 plugin and a £130 plugin reverb will kick the arse off any hardware reverb you can get for
